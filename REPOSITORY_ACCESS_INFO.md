# Repository Access & Visibility

## Current Status

Your repository is currently **PUBLIC**, which means:

### ✅ What This Means
- **Anyone can view** your code on GitHub
- **Anyone can download/clone** your code
- **Anyone can see** your commit history
- **Search engines** can index your repository
- **Open source** - visible to the world

### 🔒 Making It Private

If you want to keep your code private (recommended for a Kickstarter project before launch):

#### Option 1: Via GitHub Website
1. Go to: https://github.com/dcreply4u/ai-tuner-agent/settings
2. Scroll down to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change visibility"**
4. Select **"Make private"**
5. Type the repository name to confirm
6. Click **"I understand, change repository visibility"**

#### Option 2: Via API (I can do this for you)
Just ask me to make it private and I'll update it!

### 📊 Access Levels

**PUBLIC Repository:**
- ✅ Anyone can view
- ✅ Anyone can clone/download
- ✅ Visible in search
- ❌ Only you can push (unless you add collaborators)

**PRIVATE Repository:**
- ✅ Only you (and collaborators) can view
- ✅ Only you (and collaborators) can clone
- ❌ Not visible in search
- ✅ Better for pre-launch projects
- ✅ Protects your IP before Kickstarter

### 🎯 Recommendations for Your Kickstarter

**Before Launch:**
- **PRIVATE** - Keep your code private until launch
- Protects your intellectual property
- Prevents competitors from seeing your work
- You can make it public later

**After Launch:**
- **PUBLIC** - If you want to build a community
- Shows transparency
- Allows contributions
- Builds trust

### 🔐 Current Access

Right now, anyone can:
- View: https://github.com/dcreply4u/ai-tuner-agent
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/dcreply4u/ai-tuner-agent.git`
- Download as ZIP
- See all your code, commits, and history

### 💡 What Should You Do?

For a **Kickstarter project**, I recommend:
1. **Make it PRIVATE** now (protect your IP)
2. Keep it private until launch
3. Consider making it public after successful launch (optional)
4. Or keep it private if you want to maintain exclusivity
