Power Supply
WARNING
You can connect your VBOX 3i to other Racelogic input modules, including the ADC03 ,ADC02 ,TC8,FIM02 /3
and multifunction displays. The voltage supply to Racelogic modules connected to the VBOX unit will be at the
same level as the VBOX unit's power input. Therefore, when you are using any of the Racelogic peripherals with
VBOX 3i units, the input voltage must not exceed 15 V. If you input a higher voltage, you can damage the module

and possibly the VBOX unit.
The primary source of power to VBOX 3i units is the Power Supply - LEMO 2-way Plug . This is terminated in a
2-way connector and mates with the 2-way PWR socket on the VBOX unit.
VBOX 3i units can, however, be powered from a wide range of voltage sources. If you are considering batteries as a
power source, note that the minimum operating voltage of a VBOX 3i unit is 7 V and that the maximum operating
voltage input must not exceed 30 V DC. If you use voltages that are outside these ranges, you can damage the
VBOX unit.
If you are running the VBOX 3i unit from a battery pack, the unit will sound a warning tone to indicate when the
battery voltage is reaching the minimum operating voltage level. You must recharge or replace the battery pack when
you hear this tone.
The VBOX 3i units have been designed to generate as little heat as possible and have a wide operating temperature
range. However, it is good practice to mount your VBOX unit in a position where it has sufficient airflow around the
case.
Note: You must connect the GNSS antenna to the VBOX unit before you connect the power. The VBOX unit will look
for a connected GNSS antenna on power-up and will automatically adjust its gain for optimum performance.
External RACELOGIC modules operate from a 12 V vehicle supply. Therefore, the VBOX supply must not exceed 15
V DC when you are using external modules.
Compact Flash Memory Cards (CF Cards)
The VBOX units will store logged data onto CF cards. The CF cards that are available from Racelogic are already
optimised for use with the VBOX units, and as such, they do not need to be formatted before use.
Should the CF card need formatting due to card errors, and the card is smaller than 32 GB, you can do this through
Windows. If the card is larger than 32 GB, you must use third-party applications to reformat them. You can find more
information about how to format a large Flash card in FAT32 here .
Note: You can purchase CF cards directly from Racelogic and our distributors ,or you can contact us to confirm
card compatibility.
IMPORTANT
Do not remove the CF card or power down the VBOX unit while the unit is logging (CF LED is flashing). This can
lead to data loss or corruption. Press the LOG button to stop the logging first.

USB
VBOX 3i units have a USB 2.0 connector that you can use to configure your VBOX unit and output real-time serial
data at the full 100 Hz data rate.
Before you connect your VBOX unit to your computer, you must make sure that you have downloaded and installed
theVBOX Setup software . This will install the required USB drivers on your computer.
The software installation will place the VBOX USB drivers in the following location on your computer. C:\Program
Files\Racelogic\Drivers.
When you connect a powered-up VBOX 3i to your computer with the supplied USB lead, your PC will recognise the
presence of new hardware and open the typical Windows install window for new hardware. Follow the on-screen
prompts and point the Windows installation to the location of your drivers.
You can also download USB drivers forVBOX 3ifrom the Drivers and Utilities section onvboxautomotive.co.uk.

Connectors
You can find more information about the different inputs and outputs here .
BLUETOOTHVBOX 3i units come equipped with a Bluetooth radio
allowing configuration of the VBOX unit remotely along
with the remote output of real-time VBOX serial data, at
the full 100 Hz data rate, to any Bluetooth capable PC or
data logger.
A INThis is the analogue input connector. Each of the four
analogue input channels on a VBOX 3i unit has a
dedicated analogue converter. Data is recorded from
each channel simultaneously. The analogue input

=== PAGE 7 ===
connector also provides two power outputs that may be
used for driving sensors.
PWRThis is the power connector. VBOX 3i units can accept a
supply voltage between 7 and 30 V DC.
AD1The AD1 port has 1 analogue voltage and 1 digital
output. The digital output is a simple on/off state output
thatcan be associated with any of the data channels
being logged by the VBOX. You can set a threshold
level for the selected data channel, where a true
condition gives a 5 V output and a false condition gives
a 0 V output. You can also associate hysteresis and
tolerance values with this condition. The default function
of this digital output is to indicate the current logging
status of the VBOX.
AD2The AD2 port has 1 analogue voltage and 1 digital
output. The digital output is a frequency/pulse output
that corresponds to velocity. You can adjust the pulse
per metre range in the software. The voltage range of
the analogue output is 0 to 5 V DC.
D INThe ‘D IN’ connector contains the two digital inputs for
the VBOX 3i RTK.
•Theevent marker/brake trigger input is connected
to an event capture input on the GNSS engine. This
captures precisely the trigger event time (10 ns
resolution). A handheld event marker is also
available so that you can record marker events in
thedata file.
•A remote logging on/off switch is also available for
ease of use and in situations when the front panel
switch is not easily accessible.
CAN*The secondary RS232 port is used for connection to a
Telemetry Radio module allowing the reception of
Differential GPS (DGPS) data for local correction from a
Racelogic Local DGPS base station, or Moving Base
solution. The secondary RS232 port is located in the
connector marked CAN on the VBOX 3i front panel.

=== PAGE 8 ===
SER*The primary RS232 port is used for all communication
between the VBOX 3i unit and a laptop PC. The primary
port is marked SER on the front panel.
Note: Due to the max bandwidth being 115200, live data
transfer of all channels is limited to 20 Hz. 50 Hz should
only be used to transmit standard GPS channels and
Solution Type, and 100 Hz can only transmit Sats, Time,
Speed, and Trigger Event Time. Logging too many
channels at too high a rate will cause drop-outs and loss
of data. For maximum accuracy, you should log tests
performed at a GPS sample rate above 20 Hz to
compact flash and do a post-process analysis.
AUDIOVBOX 3i units can record audio tags synched with a set
GNSS timestamp, with an accuracy of 0.5 seconds.
USBVBOX 3i units include a USB 2.0 connection that you
can use to configure your VBOX unit and output real-
time serial data at the full 100 Hz data rate.
ANTENNA A The primary antenna connector.
ANTENNA B The secondary antenna connector.
*You can configure the function of the CAN and SER ports with VBOX Setup and swap the Racelogic Bus profile. The
Racelogic CAN bus is used for connected Racelogic modules or displays. The Vehicle CAN bus (VCI) is for use by third-
party CAN equipment, whether you are logging to or from the VBOX. For dual use of RS232 and CAN from one of the
sockets you will need to use a 5-way Lemo splitter (RLVBACS024).
IMPORTANT
Power supplied to external Racelogic CAN modules through the CAN or SER cables is at the same voltage as the
input power supply. When you are using Racelogic external CAN modules (eg; MFD or ADC03), you must make sure
that the VBOX 3i supply voltage does not exceed 15 V DC.

Compact Flash
This is the CF Card slot on the front panel of the VBOX 3i unit. It accepts Type I compact flash cards to log data.
Buttons
VBOX 3i units has two membrane buttons on the front panel, LOG andFUNC .LOG is used to start and stop logging
to the compact flash card, and FUNC is used to switch between two sample rates, 100 Hz and 20 Hz.
LOG
TheLOG button will override any of the automatic logging thresholds set in the VBOX unit. For example, if you have
set the VBOX unit to log all the time, the LOG button will toggle logging on and off. If you have set the VBOX unit to
’log only when moving ’ and you are moving, pressing the LOG button will stop the VBOX unit logging and close the

file on the compact flash card. Logging will now not continue, even if you are moving, until you press the LOG button
again or you remove the compact flash card and reinsert it. The VBOX unit will then continue to log only when
moving.
Notes:
•If the VBOX unit is using ‘ log only when moving ’ log mode, and the vehicle has been stationary from power-up,
theLOG button will not initiate logging. Ifyou want the VBOX unit to log in this situation, you have to use VBOX
Manager orVBOX Setup tochange the log mode to ‘ Log Continuous ’.
•Every time the logging is toggled with the LOG button, a new file is created.
•When the VBOX unit is logging, the green LOG LED will be solid and theblue CF light will flash.
Coldstart
Press and hold the LOG button for 5 seconds to initiate a coldstart .
IMPORTANT
Do not remove the CF card or power down the unit while the CF LED is flashing. If you need to remove the
card or power down the unit and the CF LED is flashing, you must press the LOG button first to manually
stop the VBOX unit from logging. If you don't do this you can lose the data or corrupt the card.
FUNC
Pressing the FUNC button briefly flashes the LOG LED and beeps to indicate the current sample rate. A slow flash
(once per second) indicates 20 Hz, and rapid flash (5 times a second) indicates a 100 Hz sample rate. Pressing and
holding the FUNC button for 5 seconds toggles the log rate between 20 Hz and 100 Hz. The sample rate can also be
set using VBOX Manager or VBOX Setup.
Default Setup
You can restore the default factory settings on VBOX 3i unit by pressing and holding the FUNC andLOG buttons
simultaneously for 10 seconds. This will trigger the reset process. There will be an audible notification beep and tune
playing when the process has completed.

Inertial Measurements
►IMU
Racelogic's Inertial Measurement Unit (RLVBIMU04) provides highly accurate measurements of pitch, roll, and
yaw rate using three rate gyros, as well as x, y, and z acceleration via three accelerometers.
1.Mount the IMU in the test vehicle (use the appropriate method based on your IMU variant , mounting
accessories and test scenario)
2.Connect the Lemo connector of the RLCAB119 cable to the CAN/KF port on the IMU unit.
3.Connect the analogue connector on the other end of the cable to the A IN port on the front panel of the
VBOX 3i Dual Antenna.
4.Apply power to the VBOX unit.
IMPORTANT
If you are using IMU Integration, you must disable it before you set any vehicle or line reference points. You can
enable it again after you have finished setting the points.
Integration
When you have connected the IMU to the VBOX unit, you must configure the IMU integration in VBOX Setup .
Initialisation
When using IMU integration, an initialisation phase is required .This will happen when the IMU is connected to
the VBOX unit after being set up. The initialisation process will automatically run after the VBOX unit has
successfully gained satellite lock. When the initialisation process is complete, the IMU LED on the front panel of
the VBOX unit will start flashing green.
Kalman Filter Calibration
When using an IMU filter it is important to perform the full calibration procedure before meaningful testing
commences. The calibration procedure is a series of specific manoeuvres that should be performed that help the
Kalman filter characterise the outputs from the IMU.
Click here to see the Kalman filter calibration information.
If you have enabled IMU Integration, you must perform the full calibration procedure before you can start to
produce meaningful test results. The calibration procedure is a series of specific manoeuvres that you
should perform tohelp the Kalman Filter characterise the outputs from the IMU.

04_Installing_VBOX_3i_Dual_Antenna_(v5)_Units

=== PAGE 23 ===
If you do not perform the calibration procedure, the Kalman Filter will still function. It may, however, not
produce a high level of accuracy until after you have performed dynamic manoeuvres in the X and Y plane
(i.e. left and right-hand turns, braking and accelerating) which could take several minutes of driving.
Recommended procedure
1.Park the vehicle in an open area where the GNSS antenna has a clear view of the sky.
2.Make sure that you have RTK fix.
3.Remain static and wait for the IMU to complete the 30-second stationary initialization.
Note : If the IMU detects movement before the initialisation finishes, the 30-second process will restart
when the vehicle is stationary again.
4.When the LED on the front panel of the IMU changes from flashing orange to flashing green,
drive forward to complete the initialisation of the IMU.
5.Continue to an open area to perform the calibration procedure.
6.Drive in a figure of eight at least twice. The vehicle should be at a speed of more than 5 km/h during this
procedure to generate sufficient force for the calibration process.
Note: If you cannot do figure of eights, you can perform left/right slalom-type manouvres to achieve a similar
effect.

04_Installing_VBOX_3i_Dual_Antenna_(v5)_Units
23
=== PAGE 24 ===
7.Accelerate hard from a standstill to 50 km/h or above. Perform a brake stop with a deceleration force of
at least 0.5 g. You must perform this step twice.
Re-running the calibration
The Kalman Filter is constantly adapting its calibration depending on the information it receives from
theGNSS receiver and the IMU. Therefore, if the vehicle is left stationary for a long time, or if an External
IMU is moved from its mounting position, you should repeat the calibration procedure.
The calibration should also be repeated if there has been a communication break between the VBOX unitand
the External IMU, such as:
•You power cycle either the VBOX unit or the External IMU.
•You change the VBOX IMU settings.
•You use the VBOX Setup Software to read the VBOX unit's settings.
•You use the VBOX Setup Software to read the External IMU settings.
•You perform a GNSS Coldstart.
What happens if you do not carry out this procedure?
If you cannot carry out this procedure as above, the speed accuracy will be reduced, especially for the first
few minutes, until the Kalman Filter is able to calibrate itself.

4.1 IMU Integration
This page covers an overview and explanation of IMU integration with VBOX 3i Dual Antenna (v5) units with firmware
version 2.8.
Roof Mounting
When using the IMU roof mount, the user has the option to translate the data from the roof to another point on the
vehicle. By default, when the roof mount is enabled, a 1 m Z offset is added, translating the filtered speed down in to the
vehicle, towards the centre of gravity.
If the Kalman Filter data is required relative to an alternate or more precise location on the vehicle, then measurements
should be made from the centre of the IMU to the desired location. As the IMU is housed within the enclosure, precise
measurements are not easy to make. So a Z measurement can be taken from the centre of the GPS antenna, provided
3 cm is subtracted from the physical measurement. Translation measurements need to be made in all 3 axis, X, Y and
Z.
Required equipment
•VB3i unit (IMU04 ready)
•IMU04
•RLCAB119 VBOX –IMU connecting cable
•RLCAB001 /RLCAB066-2 –VB3i PC connection cable
•VBOX Setup Software
•VBOX Manager (optional)

9.Internal IMU Attitude channels (Head_imu, Pitch_imu, Roll_imu, Pos.Qual., Lng_Jerk, Lat_Jerk and Head_imu2)
will automatically be set to log. If IMU Attitude data is required to be displayed as a Live Serial data display (with
VBOX Test Suite), then the user must enter VBOX Setup Software and tick the channels for ' Send over serial '.
10. Perform initialisation and full calibration procedure before commencing testing.
11. If the IMU is not mounted on a flat surface, perform ' Pitch/Roll Offset 'calibration.
This will zero the Pitch_imu andRoll_imu channels. Angle offsets calibration must be performed after the
IMU kalman filter calibration has been completed, and the vehicle is static on a level surface.
12. If ADAS testing is being conducted, ensure the ADAS Mode menu shows 'Enabled '.
This setting changes the rate at which the kalman filter takes a GPS positional sample to improve the positional
performance of the filter. Whilst this is beneficial to ADAS testing, it slightly decreases the accuracy of the filtered
speed and therefore shouldn't be selected when undertaking speed based testing such as brake stops.
Note: Option not available with IMU03.

Important notes
1.To use IMU04 integration, you must use an IMU04 enabled VBOX 3i unit.
2.IMU04 cannot be used with IMU integration if it is connected to a VBOX via CAN (RLCAB120 / RLCAB005-CS).
This method of connection will only allow standard IMU channels to be logged. See using IMU as CAN
module section for details.
3.The IMU04 standard channels can also be logged when the IMU04 is connected via KF port with cable
RLCAB119, without enabling IMU integration
4.The IMU04 must be in a Racelogic CAN mode to be used for IMU Kalman Filter.
5.NBADAS -When using IMU Integration, the user cannot use Set Points functionality to define contact points in
single or multi target ADAS modes.

9.Internal IMU Attitude channels (Head_imu, Pitch_imu, Roll_imu, Pos.Qual., Lng_Jerk, Lat_Jerk and Head_imu2)
will automatically be set to log. If IMU Attitude data is required to be displayed as a Live Serial data display (with
VBOX Test Suite), then the user must enter VBOX Setup Software and tick the channels for ' Send over serial '.
10. Perform initialisation and full calibration procedure before commencing testing.
11. If the IMU is not mounted on a flat surface, perform ' Pitch/Roll Offset 'calibration.
This will zero the Pitch_imu andRoll_imu channels. Angle offsets calibration must be performed after the
IMU kalman filter calibration has been completed, and the vehicle is static on a level surface.
12. If ADAS testing is being conducted, ensure the ' ADAS Mode ' menu shows 'Enabled '.
This setting changes the rate at which the kalman filter takes a GPS positional sample to improve the positional
performance of the filter. Whilst this is beneficial to ADAS testing, it slightly decreases the accuracy of the filtered
speed and therefore shouldn't be selected when undertaking speed based testing such as brake stops.
Note: Option not available with IMU03.

Important notes
1.To use IMU04 integration, you must use an IMU04 enabled VBOX 3i unit.
2.IMU04 cannot be used with IMU integration if it is connected to a VBOX via CAN (RLCAB120 / RLCAB005-CS).
This method of connection will only allow standard IMU channels to be logged. See using IMU as CAN module
section for details.
3.The IMU04 standard channels can also be logged when the IMU04 is connected via KF port with cable
RLCAB119, without enabling IMU integration.
4.The IMU04 must be in a Racelogic CAN mode to be used for IMU Kalman Filter.
5.NBADAS -If using IMU Integration with an ADAS mode, the GPS antenna and IMU should be co-located (roof
mount) or positioned so there is no relative X or Y offset between them. If there is a difference, manual contact
points should reference the IMU location, rather than the GPS antenna.
6.NBADAS -When using IMU Integration, the user cannot use Set Points functionality to define contact points in
single or multi target ADAS modes.
Wheel Speed Inputs
Vehicle speed data can be combined with inertial IMU data to provide increased data accuracy in environments that
have poor satellite reception, such as areas with trees, buildings, bridges or tunnels. M ore information on this can be
found here .
In order to obtain the wheel speed information, the best solution is to use the sensors already fitted to the vehicle by
connecting to the vehicle’s CAN bus by using an RLCAB069L, RLCAB015L or RLACS182L cable. Before testing
commences, ensure that the VB3i unit is correctly connected to either the speed sensors or to the vehicle CAN bus.
Wheel speed input needs to be 'Enabled ' and configured, this can be done via the VBOX Setup Software or using the
VBOX Manager . However, wheel speed CAN inputs can only be configured using VBOX Setup Software.
VBOX Setup Software
1.Ensure IMU04 is connected via RLCAB119, and the VBOX 3i is powered on.
2.Connect VBOX 3i to a computer either via Bluetooth, an RLCAB001 cable to the 'SER'input and the computer's
serial port ( usb-serial adapter may be required) , or via an RLCAB066-2 cable to one of the computer's USB ports.
3.Open VBOX Setup and connect to VBOX 3i by selecting COM Port .
4.Select the ' IMU' menu and then the 'Wheel speed input ' tab.

5.Select ' Enabled ' within the'Wheel speed input ' section.
6.Enter the Antenna to wheel reference point offsets , these are the x,y,z distances (m) between wheel speed
reference point and the antenna. The reference point is the centre point between the rear wheels, as shown in the
image below.

7.Use the Wheel speed 1 and 2 ' Configure ' buttons to open up the CAN setup area where you can load in a .dbc file
or manually set up the CAN parameters by selecting the ' User ' option. Alternatively, selecting 'Vehicle
database 'enables you to browse the Racelogic Vehicle CAN database within the software and select your
vehicle. Once selected, CAN channels specific to your vehicle will appear on the left. If available, CAN
connection information for the vehicle will also appear on the right of the window. Click on a wheel speed channel
and select ' OK' to save the configuration. Repeat for the other wheel speed channel.
