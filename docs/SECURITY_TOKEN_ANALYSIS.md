# Security Token Analysis - Revenue-Backed Token

## Understanding What You're Proposing

You're describing a **Security Token** (not a utility token):
- Backed by projected revenue
- Backed by software/hardware sales
- Essentially tokenized equity/investment
- Investors expect returns based on company performance

**This is VERY different from utility tokens and has MUCH higher regulatory requirements.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SEC Regulations

### Security Token = Securities Law Applies

If a token is:
- ✅ Backed by revenue/profits
- ✅ Backed by company assets
- ✅ Investors expect returns
- ✅ Represents ownership/stake

**Then it's a SECURITY under SEC regulations.**

### SEC Requirements (US):

1. **Registration or Exemption Required**
   - Must register with SEC (expensive, complex)
   - OR use exemption (Reg D, Reg A+, Reg S, etc.)
   - **Cannot just launch publicly**

2. **Investor Restrictions**
   - **Reg D (506c)**: Accredited investors only
     - $1M+ net worth OR $200k+ annual income
     - Limits investor pool significantly
   - **Reg A+**: Public offering, but still regulated
     - Up to $75M
     - Requires SEC review
   - **Reg S**: Offshore only (non-US investors)

3. **Disclosure Requirements**
   - Financial statements
   - Business plan
   - Risk disclosures
   - Ongoing reporting
   - **Extensive documentation**

4. **Legal Structure**
   - Proper corporate structure
   - Operating agreements
   - Token holder rights
   - Governance structure

5. **Costs**
   - Legal: $100k-500k+
   - Accounting/audit: $50k-200k+
   - Compliance: Ongoing $50k-200k/year
   - **Total: $200k-1M+ upfront, ongoing costs**
