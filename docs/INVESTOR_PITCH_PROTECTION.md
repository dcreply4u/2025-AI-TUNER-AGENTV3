- ❌ Customer-specific data

---

### Stage 3: Due Diligence (NDA + Additional Agreements)

**Share After NDA + LOI/Term Sheet:**
- ✅ Code repository access (read-only, limited)
- ✅ Technical documentation
- ✅ Test results, benchmarks
- ✅ Security documentation
- ✅ Customer testimonials (with permission)
- ✅ Financial information

**Protections:**
- Read-only access

## Sample Investor Communication

### Email Template: Requesting NDA

**Subject:** NDA Required for Technical Discussion

**Body:**

Hi [Investor Name],

Thank you for your interest in TelemetryIQ. We're excited to discuss the opportunity with you.

Before we proceed with technical details and code access, we'll need to execute a mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect our intellectual property.

This is standard practice for technology companies and protects both parties during due diligence discussions.

I've attached our standard NDA template. Please review and let me know if you have any questions or modifications.

Once executed, I'll be happy to provide:
- Technical architecture overview
- Detailed feature demonstrations
- Code repository access (read-only, limited scope)
- Any other information needed for your evaluation

Looking forward to moving forward.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Negotiation Tips

### If Investor Resists NDA

**Response:**
"We understand your position. However, as a technology company with proprietary algorithms and trade secrets, we require an NDA before sharing technical details. This is standard practice and protects both parties. We're happy to discuss business aspects without an NDA, but technical discussions require protection."

### If NDA Terms Are Unfavorable

**Negotiate:**
- Duration (2-5 years is standard)
- Scope (limit to what's necessary)
- Exclusions (public information)
- Remedies (injunctive relief)
- Code-specific protections

**Don't Accept:**
- Perpetual confidentiality (unless trade secrets)
- One-sided terms (unless you have leverage)
- Vague definitions
- No remedies
