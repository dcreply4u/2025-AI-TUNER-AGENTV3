4.3 CAN
This page covers CAN information for the VBOX 3i Dual Antenna (v5) units with firmware version 2.8.
Racelogic CAN Bus
TheRacelogic CAN bus connection ( CAN port by default) can be used to connect Racelogic modules (i.e. TC8, FIM03
etc), and displays such as VBOX Manager and Multi-Function Display. This port will allow the VBOX 3i to log up to a
maximum of 32 Racelogic module channels.
Note: For the Racelogic CAN port, it is recommended that the CAN Termination resistor is on.
Note: VBOX 3i has an additional channel limit of 64. Additional channels consist of VCI channels (up to 16), RL CAN
channels (up to 32) and any other channels that fall outside the channels on the Standard tabin VBOX Setup, such as
AD inputs, IMU KF channels, Twin antennas channels, ADAS channels and so on.
Channel selection is controlled using VBOX Setup. Additional channels can be logged by the VBOX 3i up until the point
the Log channel usage is maxed (100%)

04_Installing_VBOX_3i_Dual_Antenna_(v5)_Units/4.3_CAN
57
=== PAGE 8 ===
Channel usage
The log channel usage is influenced by what operational mode the VBOX 3i is in. For example, if the IMU filter is
enabled, the number of channels available to log will be reduced.
CAN channel availability – Multi-Function Display
A Multi-Function Display (RLDSP03) can display any channel that is present on the Racelogic CAN bus, and in the first
32 CAN channel ordering.
First 32 CAN channel ordering priority goes to any external data source. Therefore if there are 32 external channels set
to log by the VBOX 3i, no internal module channel will be present for selection on the MFD.
CAN channel availability – send over serial
Same as the MFD, a data channel must be in the first 32 CAN channel ordering for the VBOX 3i to send out data over
serial to a ‘live data window’ on VBOX Test Suite.
First 32 CAN channel ordering priority goes to any external data source. Therefore if there are 32 external channels set
to log by the VBOX 3i, no internal module channel will be present for selection on the MFD.
VCI Input (Vehicle CAN Interface)
TheVehicle CAN bus (VCI) connection ( SER port by default) can be used to connect to a vehicle CAN or a sensor
CAN bus. This port will allow VBOX 3i to log up to a maximum of 16 channels.
Note: For the VCI CAN port, it is recommended that the CAN Termination resistor is off when connected to a vehicle's
CAN bus.

=== PAGE 9 ===
Configuration is performed using the Internal CAN Input tab in the Channels menu within VBOX Setup software. CAN
signal parameters can be entered manually by the user or imported directly from a CAN database (.dbc) file if available.
Racelogic Vehicle CAN Database
Racelogic supplies a free, encrypted vehicle CAN database, giving the user the ability to log basic CAN data from a
large number of current vehicles from a broad selection of manufacturers.
All of the CAN database files for vehicles we have reverse engineered can be downloaded from our website .
Please note to access these downloads you will need a username and password - to retrieve this, please register (or
re-register) your VBOX unit.
VB3i CAN Pass Through
It is possible to output channel data from the Racelogic CAN bus (i.e. Racelogic modules such as TC8) on the isolated
customer VCI bus. The user can configure output data (in VBOX Setup) using channels from the available channels
dropdown list, and configure the identifier as required.
Example application: Racelogic IMU connected to the Racelogic CAN bus to use IMU yaw rate for improved dual
antenna slip translation data. Same IMU data being transmitted from the customer VCI bus to be logged by third party
CAN logging equipment.
The VBOX 3i can output up to 6 user configured CAN messages, and 12 CAN channels over the customer VCI bus.
Be aware of checking CAN pass through channel selection when re-entering VBOX Setup. If the VBOX has many
external CAN channels being logged, then the dropdown channel selection can re-adjust. When VBOX Setup is then
exited, the adjusted CAN channels will be applied.

Note: If you are loading VB3i configuration settings from a previously saved .RCF file and external modules were
connected during the save, selected CAN pass through channels may not be reloaded correctly. Please check and
directly configure the channels through VBOX Setup.
Note: These output CAN channels will be in a 32 bit IEEE float format. 29 bit extended identifiers optional.
VB3i CANVEL
If an input channel is given the name ' CANVEL ', then the VBOX will translate the data of this channel directly through to
the GPS speed channel under the following criteria.
•IMU integration is not enabled
•The VBOX cannot calculate speed, i.e. no satellite signal (complete satellite drop out)
The VBOX will scale the input channel to the default speed output format of km/h according to what units have been

assigned to the substitution speed channel. VBOX will recognise the following unit names: MPH, KM/H, Knots, m/s, and
ms-1.
Note: If no UNITS have been assigned to the input channel then VBOX will assume that it is KM/H.
This function is useful while testing around built up areas or driving under large bridges.
VB3i CAN Termination
TheVBOX 3i contains an active termination between 0 Ohms and 120 Ohms, the active terminations are selectable
viaVBOX Setup as shown below.
Note: When the Usage of the CAN ports is swapped from one output socket to the other the termination resistor setting

does not follow. So you should check that the Termination is correctly set for the output socket that you are then using.
VB3i CAN Delay
When to Use the Fixed CAN Delay?
‘Fixed CAN Delay’ is recommended for use when using an external event marker or trigger, or for other external CAN
devices that require precisely timed CAN outputs. This is the default setting.
‘Fixed’ and ‘Minimum’ CAN Delay
When CAN Delay is set to ‘Fixed’, the speed delay is 15.5 ms and the position delay is 20 ms. When CAN delay is set to
‘Minimum’, the speed delay is 4 ms (±1 ms) and the position delay is 8.5 ms (±1.5 ms). The data comes out faster in the
‘Minimum’ setting, but the delay is unpredictable.
Note: Do not use Minimum CAN Delay mode if you are using a lot of Racelogic input modules connected to the CAN
bus as the variability of the output could cause loss of samples from the modules.

05 Setup
An overview of the VBOX Setup software connected to a VBOX 3i Dual Antenna (v5) units with firmware version 2.8.
From this page you can find links to more information about the individual menus available in the Setup software.
Introduction
VBOX Setup Software can be used to configure VB3i and provides greater functionality in comparison to using aVBOX
Manager .
Connection
To configure VB3i , the VBOX needs to be connected to a power source and a PC.
Configuration can be performed using VBOX Setup software, which can be downloaded here . You can connect to a
computer via Bluetooth, an RLCAB001 cable to the 'SER'input and the computer's serial port ( USB-serial adapter may
be required) , or via an RLCAB066-2 cable to one of the computer's USB ports.
IMPORTANT
•Ensure that the VB3i USB-COM port drivers are installed to enable communication between the VBOX
and the software, available to download from here . If a USB-serial adapter is being used, the RS232 to
USB Converter driver is required.
•Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 or newer is required (must be compatible with .Net Framework 4.7.1).
For ADAS applications, connection between the VB3i and computer should be made via USB or Bluetooth to
ensure optimum performance.
Once physically connected and powered, open the software and use the drop down list to select the correct COM port
that the VB3i is connected to. VBOX Setup automatically connects to the selected device and enters the VB3i setup
screen.

Inputs/Outputs – VBOX 3i Dual Antenna (v5)
An overview and explanation of the inputs and outputs on the VBOX 3i Dual Antenna (v5) unit with firmware version 2.8.
Analogue Inputs
For PIN outs of the Analogue Input Connector click here .
The VBOX 3i contains four differential 24 bit analogue input channels with a maximum sample rate of 500 Hz. Each
channel has its own dedicated analogue to digital (A/D) converter with all four channels being sampled synchronously to
each other. The voltage range of the input channels is ±50 V. Note that, unlike the ADC03 module, the analogue
channels in the VBOX 3i are not electrically isolated from each other.
The analogue input connector also contains voltage outputs that can be used to power external sensors. These are a
Vbatt connection which is equal to the VBOX input voltage level and a 5 V DC out connection which is equal to 5 V ±2%.
The 5 V out connection is electrically isolated, allowing for up to 120 mA of current to be drawn.
The Vbatt connection is internally protected by a thermal fuse at 300 mA
A screw-terminal connector block is available as an option for easy connection of signal pins.

Note: A 25 W D-sub to 4 W BNC adaptor block is available through your VBOX distributor, part number RLVBACS054
Using VBOX Setup software, logging of the analogue channel data can be switched on or off. It is also possible to
change the name of each input channel and configure scale and offset values for calibration of sensors. A scale value of
1 and offset of 0 correspond to a channel reading in V DC. This means that the value stored on the compact flash card
for the channel will also be in volts. When using a sensor such as a load cell, it may be desirable to store a reading in
kg. In this case, changing the scale and offset to suit the sensor data sheet allows the data stored onto the compact
flash to be in kg. When changing settings for an analogue channel using VBOX Setup software, a live data view of the
current channel is shown. The value shown is the value after scale and offset is applied and can therefore be used to aid
sensor calibration.
Note: The 5 V regulated output on pin16 is only good for VBOX power supply voltages >8.5 V

500 Hz logging
VB3i has the ability to log 4x analogue channels at 500 Hz. With this feature enabled, the file sizes will increase as a
result.

The 500 Hz analogue logging functionality is only fully supported when Fixed CAN timing is used.
When loading the VBO file into VBOX Test Suite, ensure you are running the very latest version as older versions are
not compatible with 500 Hz data.
Within VBOX Setup ,the 500 Hz option is available within the'Logging ' settings, as shown below.
VBOX Setup A/D 500 Hz
Digital Inputs
The ‘D IN’ connector contains the two digital inputs for the VBOX 3i. Digital input 1 is also referred to as the brake trigger
input. This input is connected to an event capture input on the GPS engine. This captures precisely the trigger event
time (10 ns resolution) for use in brake distance calculation. The trigger event time is logged and used to correct the
measured brake stop distance to the exact point at which the trigger was pressed.
A hand-held event marker is also available to allow the user to record marker events in the VBOX 3i data file.
A remote logging on/off switch is also available for ease of use and when the front panel switch is not accessible.

Analogue and Digital Outputs
The AD1 and AD2 connectors each have 1 analogue voltage and 1 digital output. The digital output on connector AD2 is
a frequency/pulse output corresponding to velocity. The pulse per meter range is adjustable in software. The digital
output on connector AD1 is a simple on/off state output. This digital output can be associated with any of the data
channels being logged by the VBOX. A threshold level can be set for the selected data channel where a true condition
gives a 5 V output and a false condition gives a 0 V.
i.e. Data channel –Speed, threshold 40 km/h. When speed is >40 output = 5 V, speed, 40 output = 0 V.
A hysteresis and tolerance value can also be associated to this condition.
The default function of this digital output is to indicate the current logging status of the VBOX.
The analogue outputs on connectors AD1 and AD2 are both user configurable. For example, analogue output 1 could be
configured to output velocity while analogue output 2 might be configured to output lateral acceleration. The voltage
range of both analogue outputs is 0 to 5 V DC.
